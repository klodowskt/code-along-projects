# code-along-projects

Small sample projects (using HTML + CSS with a little Javascript here and there) I made from following along with [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog) on Youtube.

Uploading them to github to help familiarize myself with using git.

- Glassmorphism calculator with Vanilla Tilt.js functionality
- Working analog clock with light/dark mode
- Digital clock (still working on alternating 24HR/12HR capability)
- Simple 16 character random password generator with copy to clipboard functionality
- Semi-interactive iPhone box mockup with drop shadow
